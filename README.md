# Grammar-Project
 Final project for CS 2420 - Intro to Data Structures and Algorithms
 
 ---
 
This project was completed as a cumulative assignment for CS 2420, entirely by Chandler Copyak (no GH account) and me. Example grammar files were provided by Dr. Erin Parker at the University of Utah. This assignment was completed prior to us learning about version control, hence the entire project being pushed in a single commit.
